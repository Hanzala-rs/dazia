# DAZIA

Local-first personal assistant (FastAPI + Ollama + SQLite). No paid AI APIs; nothing leaves the laptop on the default path.

## Model
- Default: `qwen3.5:4b` (Q4_K_M, ~3.1 GB RAM loaded), run with thinking off.
- Benchmarked on i3-1115G4 / 12 GB: ~6 tok/s, ~11 s per request warm, ~21 s first load. `llama3.1:8b` was slower (~4.4 tok/s, 5.3 GB).
- Change with `DAZIA_OLLAMA_MODEL` in `.env`.

## Install
```powershell
ollama pull qwen3.5:4b
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env   # optional; defaults work
```

## Run
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m app.main
```
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000. The server binds to localhost only.

## Test
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q
```

## Data & backup
Reminders live in `dazia.db` (SQLite, path set by `DAZIA_DB_PATH`). Back up by copying the file while the server is stopped; delete it to wipe all data.

## Troubleshooting
- Banner "model can't load": start Ollama and run `ollama pull qwen3.5:4b`.
- Slow replies: close heavy apps; the first request after start loads the model (~20 s).
